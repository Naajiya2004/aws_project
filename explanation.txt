I designed a custom VPC named Interview-vpc with a 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR block to provide a scalable private network.
Within the VPC, I created four subnets—two public and two private—distributed across availability zones to improve availability and fault tolerance.
Public subnets were configured with an Internet Gateway and appropriate route table to enable outbound/inbound internet traffic.
Private subnets were associated with a NAT Gateway route table, allowing secure outbound internet access while preventing external inbound traffic.
Each subnet was assigned its own CIDR range (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24), ensuring logical network segmentation and isolation of application tiers.
This structure supports a standard 3-tier architecture, enhances security, and provides flexibility for deploying scalable workloads.
